Getting Started:
  The fist step in the process was setting up React using create-react-app. Then a directory was created in React. In order to start the clientside UI you have to first enter the directory and then start react by typing "npm start" this will allow you to make changes to the virtual dom. The next step was to make sure all of the proper Components are created. Each one of the components has a specific task on the DOM. Each Component included a .js, .css, and index.js file. An index.html file was created as a template.
